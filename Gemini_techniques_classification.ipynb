        "\n",
        "1.Causal_Oversimplification\n",
        "Assuming a single cause or reason when there are actually multiple causes for an issue.\n",
        "It includes transferring  blame to one  person or  group of people without investigating  the complexities of the issue\n",
        "Example 1: \"President Trump has been in office for a month and gas prices have been skyrocketing. The rise in gas prices is because of President Trump.\"\n",
        "Example 2: The reason New Orleans was hit so hard with the hurricane was\n",
        "because of all the immoral people who live there.\n",
        "Explanation: This was an actual argument seen in the months that followed\n",
        "hurricane Katrina. Ignoring the validity of the claims being made,\n",
        "the arguer is blaming a natural disaster on a group of people. Example 3: if France had not have declared war on Germany then world war two\n",
        "would have never happened.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Appeal_to_authority\n",
        "Stating that a claim is true simply because a valid authority or expert on the issue said it was true, without any other supporting evidence offered. We consider the special case in which the reference is not an authority or an expert in this technique, altough it is referred to as Testimonial in literature.\n",
        "Example: Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true. Explanation: Richard Dawkins certainly knows about evolution, and he can confidently tell us that it is true, but that doesn't make it true. What makes it true is the preponderance of evidence for the theory. Example 2: \"According to Serena Williams, our foreign policy is the best on Earth. So we are in the right direction.\" Details: since there is a chance that any authority can be wrong, it is reasonable to defer to an authority to support a claim, but the authority should not be the only justification to accept the claim, otherwise the Appeal-to-Authority fallacy is committed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Black-and-white_Fallacy\n",
        "Presenting two alternative options as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist. As an the extreme case, tell the audience exactly what actions to take, eliminating any other possible choices (Dictatorship).\n",
        "Example 1: You must be a Republican or Democrat. You are not a Democrat. Therefore, you must be a Republican Example 2: I thought you were a good person, but you weren't at church today. Explanation: The assumption here is that if one doesn't attend church, one must be bad. Of course, good people exist who don't go to church, and good church-going people could have had a really good reason not to be in church. Example 3: There is no alternative to war\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Name_Calling _Labeling\n",
        "Labeling the object of the propaganda campaign as either something the target audience fears, hates, finds undesirable or loves, praises.\n",
        "Examples: \"Republican congressweasels\", \"Bush the Lesser\" (note that lesser does not refer to \"the second\", but it is pejorative)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Loaded_Language\n",
        "Using specific words and phrases with strong emotional implications (either positive or negative) to influence an audience.\n",
        "Example 1: \"[...] a lone lawmaker's childish shouting. \". Example 2: \"how stupid and petty things have become in Washington\"\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Exaggeration_Minimisation\n",
        "Either representing something in an excessive manner: making things larger, better, worse (e.g., \"the best of the best\", \"quality guaranteed\") or making something seem less important or smaller than it really is (e.g., saying that an insult was just a joke).\n",
        "Example 1: \"Democrats bolted as soon as Trump's speech ended in an apparent effort to signal they can't even stomach being in the same room as the president \" Example 2: \"We're going to have unbelievable intelligence\" Example 3: I was not fighting with her; we were just playing.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Flag-Waving\n",
        "Playing on strong national feeling (or to any group; e.g., race, gender, political preference) to justify or promote an action or idea\n",
        "Example 1: \"patriotism mean no questions\" (this is also a slogan) Example 2: \"entering this war will make us have a better future in our country.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Doubt\n",
        "Questioning the credibility of someone or something.\n",
        "Example: A candidate talks about his opponent and says: Is he ready to be the Mayor?\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Appeal_to_fear-prejudice\n",
        "Seeking to build support for an idea by instilling anxiety and/or panic in the population towards an alternative. In some cases the support is built based on preconceived judgements.\n",
        "Example 1: \"either we go to war or we will perish\" (this is also a Black and White fallacy)) Example 2: \"we must stop those refugees as they are terrorists\"\n",

        "\"The next transmission could be more pronounced or stronger,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva, insisting that \"the issue is serious.\"\n",
        "An outbreak of both bubonic plague, which is spread by infected rats via flea bites, and pneumonic plague, spread person to person, has killed more than 200 people in the Indian Ocean island nation since August.\n",
        "Madagascar has suffered bubonic plague outbreaks almost every year since 1980, often caused by rats fleeing forest fires.\n",
        "The disease tends to make a comeback each hot rainy season, from September to April.\n",
        "On average, between 300 and 600 infections are recorded every year among a population approaching 25 million people, according to a UN estimate.\n",
        "But Tedros voiced alarm that \"plague in Madagascar behaved in a very, very different way this year.\"\n",
        "Cases sprang up far earlier than usual and, instead of being confined to the countryside, the disease infiltrated towns.\n",
        "The authorities recorded more than 2 000 cases, and Tedros said Wednesday the death toll stood at 207.\n",
        "He also pointed to the presence of the pneumonic version, which spreads more easily and is more virulent, in the latest outbreak.\n",
